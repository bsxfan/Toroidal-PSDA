# Toroidal-PSDA
A probabilistic scoring backend for length-normalized embeddings. 

This repo is private for now. We will open source it later.

Dependencies are numpy, scipy and [PYLLR](https://github.com/bsxfan/PYLLR).

To install, put the root (the folder that contains the package tpsda) on your python path.

A working demo is here:
(https://github.com/bsxfan/Toroidal-PSDA/blob/main/tpsda/toroidal/toroid_vs_cosred.py)
It can be run as a script.
